        ❏ In the Philippines, members of Congress had passed bills 
intended to make laws more consistent with the Philippines’ advocacy on juvenile justice.</p> 
<p>❏ As much as the Philippines should be concerned with a 
juvenile justice system in harmony with international policies, the dominant goal is to achieve a standard national policy on
CICL rather than an accurate reproduction of an international
model on CICL. </p>
<p>
    ❏ R.A. No. 9344, one bill passed into law, institutionalized the 
promotion of the well-being of child and their families, 
involvement of parents and guardians, promotion of diversion, 
avoiding deprivation of liberty and protecting the privacy 
rights of children.
</p>
<p>
  ❏  R.A. No. 10630 further emphasized child-sensitive justice 
policies focused on the best interest of the child. This 
principle has been first laid down in the Doha Declaration.
