      <p><b> A. Treatment of Children below the Age of Criminal Responsibility</b></p>
      <p>
          ❏ If it has been determined that the child taken into custody is 
15 years old or below, the authority which will have an 
initial contact with the child, in coordination with the Local
Social Welfare Development Officer (LSWDO), has the duty 
to immediately release the child to the custody of his/her 
parents or guardian, or in the absence thereof, to the child’s nearest relative.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ If they cannot be located or they refuse to take custody of the 
child, the CICL may be released to any of the following: </p>
<p>- a duly registered nongovernmental or religious 
organization, </p>
<p>- a barangay official or a member of the Barangay Council 
for the Protection of Children (BCPC), </p>
<p>- LSWDO, or the Department of Social Welfare and 
Development (DSWD)
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ Authorities which have initial contact with the child refer to law 
enforcement officers or private citizens apprehending or taking 
custody of the CICL.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ If the LSWDO determines that the child is abandoned, neglected or 
abused by his parents, and the best interest of the child requires that 
he/she be placed in a youth care facility or “Bahay Pag-asa”, the 
child’s parents or guardians shall execute a written authorization for 
the voluntary commitment of the child.
      </p>
      ❏ But if there are no parents or guardians, or they will not execute it, the 
LSWDO or the DSWD shall file the proper petition for involuntary 
commitment. Only those who are at least 12 years old can be 
committed to a youth care facility</p>
      <p><b>
          B. Treatment of CICL Depending on Whether They Acted 
with or without Discernment
      </b></p>
      <p>
          ❏ The social worker using the discernment assessment tools developed 
by the DSWD will come up with an initial assessment which is 
without prejudice to the preparation of a more comprehensive case 
study report.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ The local social worker can either release or commit the child to a 
youth care facility if he/she is 15 years or below or above 15 but 
below 18 years old but who acted without discernment.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ However, if the child is above 15 years old but below 18 and who 
acted with discernment, diversion should be implemented.
      </p>
      <p><b>
          C. System of Diversion
      </b></p>
      <p>
          ❏ If the imposable penalty for the crime is not more than six years’
imprisonment, mediation, family conferencing and conciliation, or 
other indigenous modes of conflict resolution in consonance with 
restorative justice shall be facilitated by the law enforcement 
officer or Punong Barangay with the assistance of the LSWDO or 
members of the BCPC.
      </p>
      <p>
          Both the child and his/her family shall be present in these activities
      </p>
      <p>
          In victimless crimes where the imposable penalty is not more than 
six years’ imprisonment, the LSDO shall develop an appropriate 
diversion and rehabilitation programme, in coordination with the 
BCPC.
      </p>
      <p>
          Again, involvement of the child and his/her parents or guardians is 
a must.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ Where the imposable penalty for the crime committed exceeds six 
years’ imprisonment, diversion measures will only be decided by 
the courts.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ The diversion programme shall cover socio-cultural and 
psychological services for the child which may include: </p>
<p>- reparation of the damage caused, Counselling,participation in available community,based programmes,education, vocation and life skills programmes.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ In case of failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
contract of diversion as certified by the LSWDO the offended 
party can institute the appropriate legal action.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ Also, if no diversion took place because the imposable penalty 
exceeds six years, or the child or his/her parents does not consent 
to diversion, the case shall be filed according to the regular
processes
      </p>
      <p><b>
          D. Release on Recognizance
      </b></p>
      <p>
          ❏ Where a child is detained, the court shall order the release of the 
minor on bail or release on recognizance to his/her parents and 
other suitable person. </p>
<p>❏ The court has also the option to transfer the minor to a youth care 
facility.</p> 
<p>❏ In no case shall the court order the detention of a child in a jail 
pending trial or hearing of his/her case.
      </p>
      <p><b> 
          E. Discharge of the Child in Conflict with the Law
      </b></p>
      <p>
          ❏ When at the time of the commission of the offence, the child is 
under 18 years old and subsequently he is found guilty of the 
offence charged, the court shall place the CICL under suspended
sentence without need of application.
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏ Suspension of sentence shall still be applied even if he/she is more 
than 18 years old at the time of the pronouncement of his/her guilt
      </p>
      <p>
          ❏The court shall impose the appropriate disposition measures in 
consideration of the various circumstances of the CICL. </p>
<p>❏ Upon recommendation of the social worker who has custody of the 
child, the court shall dismiss the case if it finds that the objectives
of the disposition measures have been fulfilled
      </p>
      <p><b>
          F. Confinement of Convicted Children in Agricultural 
Camps and Training Facilities
      </b></p>
      <p>
          ❏ After conviction and upon order of the court to serve his/her 
sentence, a CICL may in lieu of confinement in a regular penal 
institution, serve in an agricultural camp and other training
facilities that may be supervised by the Bureau of Correction, in 
coordination with the DSWD
      </p>
      <p><b>
          G. Competent Authority
      </b></p>
      <p>
          ❏ Family Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving 
children in conflict with the law. </p>
<p>❏ Jurisdiction is vested with Regional Trial Courts in places where 
there are no family courts.
