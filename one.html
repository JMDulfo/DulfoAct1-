   <h1>THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND WELFARE LAW</h1>
   <center><img src="content://com.android.providers.media.documents/document/image%3A1961093" width ="100%" height="100%">
   <p><b> Republic Act No. 9344 or the “Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act”</b>
defines the Juvenile Justice and Welfare System as a system dealing with 
children at risk and children in conflict with thelaw, which provides 
child-appropriate proceedings, including programmes and services for prevention, diversion, rehabilitation,
re-integration and aftercare to ensure their normal growth and development.
   </p>
   <p>Instead of using the word “juvenile”, Philippine laws made use of 
the word “child”. </p>
<p>❏ As defined in R.A. No. 9344, “Child” is a person under the age of 
eighteen (18) years. </p>
❏ While “Child at Risk” refers to a child who is vulnerable to and at 
the risk of committing criminal offences because of personal, family 
and social circumstances. Some of the examples mentioned in the 
law are: being abandoned or neglected, and living in a community 
with a high level of criminality or drug abuse.
   </p>
   <p> ❏ “Child in Conflict with the Law” or CICL on the other hand refers to a child who is alleged as, accused of, or adjudged as, having committed an offence under Philippine 
laws. </p>
<p>❏ A child can commit an act or omission whether punishable under special laws or the amended Revised Penal Code 
which is referred to as an “Offence”. </p>
<p>❏ Under Republic Act 10630, offences which only apply to a child and not to adults are called “Status Offences”.</p>
    <p> - These shall not be considered as offences and shall not
be punished if committed by a child. </p>
    <p>- Examples of status offences include curfew violations,truancy, parental disobedience and the like.
   </p>
   <p>
       ❏ Before R.A. No. 9344 was enacted, children at risk 
and CICL were treated much like adult offenders as 
when former President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. 
signed into law the Judiciary Reorganization Act
1980</p>
- which abolished the juvenile and domestic 
relations courts. As such child offenders were 
subjected to the same adversarial proceedings 
as their adult counterparts
   </p>
   <p> ❏As an offshoot of the United Nations Convention
on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the R.A. No. 
9344 - intends to deal with these children without
resorting to judicial proceedings.</p>
- Instead of punishing juvenile offenders and 
treating them as criminals, these child 
offenders will be provided by the State and the 
community with assistance to prevent them 
from committing future offences
