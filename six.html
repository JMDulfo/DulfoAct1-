<p><b>A. Who can avail?</b></p>
<p>
    ❏ One of the disposition measures that can be availed of by a CICL 
under suspended sentence is Community-based Rehabilitation
wherein he/she shall be released to parents, guardians, relatives 
or any other responsible person in the community.</p>
    <p>
        ❏ The LSWDO shall supervise the CICL in coordination with 
his/her parents/guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
        ❏ Examples of these programmes are: 
<p> -competency and life skills development; </p>
<p> -socio-cultural and recreational activities;</p> 
<p> -community volunteer projects; </p>
<p> -leadership training; </p>
<p> -spiritual enrichment; and, family welfare services </p>
<p>
    ❏ A child under the minimum age of criminal responsibility shall 
also be subjected to a community-based intervention programme
supervised by the LSWDO.
</p>
<p><b>
    B. Cooperation between Community-based 
Treatment and Institutional Treatment
</b></p>
<p>
    ❏ If the best interest of the child requires, the CICL shall be 
referred to a youth care facility or ‘Bahay Pag-asa’ managed by 
LGUs or licensed and/or accredited NGOs monitored by the

to a community-based intervention programme can be deemed a 
neglected child.

programme supervised by the LSWDO.
