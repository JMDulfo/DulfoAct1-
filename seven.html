        ❏ Aftercare support services shall be made to prevent re-offending. 
These will be given for a period of at least six months. These 
services could include:</p>
<p> life skills development, livelihood programmes and membership to existing youth organizations.

        ❏ The ultimate objective of providing the children in conflict with 
the law with interventions that will improve their social 
functioning is for them to be eventually reintegrated to their 
families and to their communities as well.
