    <p><b>A. Diversion and Intervention Programmes</p></b>
<p>❏ During the diversion process, theresponsibility and treatment of CICL will be determined on the basis of 
his/her social, cultural, economic, psychological or 
educational background without resorting to formal court proceedings</p>
<p>❏ If the CICL is found to be responsible for an offence, he/she will be required to undergo diversion programmes without resorting to formal court 
proceedings. </p>
<p>❏ During the intervention programmes on the other hand, they will undergo a series of activities to address issues 
that caused them to commit an offence. </p>
<p>❏ These may take the form of counselling, skills training, and education.</p>
<p>❏ The bigger the role these diversion and intervention 
programmes play in child behaviour development, the 
more acceptance and social legitimacy these programmes are likely to enjoy in resolving progs.</p>
<p> <b>
    B. Age of Criminal Responsibility and the Presumption of Minority
</p></b>
<p>
    ❏ R.A. No. 9344 likewise raises the age of criminal 
responsibility from nine years of age under 
Presidential Decree 603 to a minimum of 15 years 
old.
</p>
<p>
    ❏ CICLs aged 15 and above are also exempted from 
criminal liability unless the prosecution proves that 
they acted with discernment — the capacity to 
distinguish right from wrong.
</p>
<p>
    ❏ These child offenders are also afforded all the rights 
of a CICL until he/she is proven to be eighteen (18) 
years old or older under the “presumption of 
minority” rule.
</p>
<p>
    ❏ In all proceedings, law enforcement officers, 
prosecutors, judges and other government officials 
concerned are mandated to exert all efforts at 
determining the age of the CICL.
</p>
<p><b>
    C. Restorative Justice
</p></b>
<p>
    ❏ The concept of “restorative justice” as opposed to 
retributive justice has also been introduced by R.A. No. 
9344. </p>
<p>- It espouses resolving conflicts with the maximum 
involvement of the victim, the offender and the 
community. </p>
<p>- It primarily aims to achieve reparation for the victim, 
reconciliation of the offender, the offended and the 
community, and enhancement of public safety. </p>
<p>- It also ensures that the child’s rights will not be 
infringed when he/she admits to the offence.</p>
